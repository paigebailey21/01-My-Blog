One thing I learned:

I learned that there are way more blog pages out there than I expected. As I researched my topic I noticed many of the informational pages were blog, which I find very interesting. I also learned a few signs too look for in determining if a website was made with a blog template: picture links to other media, comment sections at the bottom, and sites with a wordpress ending.

One thing I still don't understand:

I do not understand how to change the themes to better fit my topic. For example, I could not get my about post to the top of the page. I just went through and found the theme that automatically put it first.
