#About 

My name is Paige Bailey. I live in Arkansas and have two majestic Clydesdale mares at home. My grandpa has owned draft horses forever. We use them to cut/bale hay, grade roads, and as transportation around the farm. The Clydesdale originated in Scotland, near the Clyde River, during the late 18th century. Farmers needed a horse that could pull heavy farm equipment. These horses usually stand between 16-18 hands tall and weigh 1,600-2,200 pounds. They are easily identified by their large size, heavy feathering on hooves, dark coloring, and often a blaze. Later, tractors began to replace draft horses and their numbers dropped drastically. They nearly became extinct and their role in World War I didnâ€™t help their numbers. Today Clydesdales are considered an at risk breed.
