## Signs Your Clydesdale Needs a Visit

In the picture above Dr. Sara is adjusting one of the budweiser clydesdales (Scooby). Just like humans atheletes, working animals can injure themselves and require an adjustment. Chiropractic care is a valuable treatment option for any performance horse, including Clydedales. They were specifically bred to pull heavy equipment, while remaining balanced and graceful. There are many things that can injure or cause discomfort like: arthritis, working long hours on uneven ground, misplacing a step, repetative stress on a muscle, bad conformation, pulling back while tied, twisting thier body while pulling, etc.  Signs that indicate your horse probably needs a visit from a chiropractor include: reluctance to accept harness/saddle, head tossing, unable to pick up correct lead, intermittent lameness, and abnormal sensitivites. A regular veterinarian can help these problems with medication, but why expose your animal to these things if it isnâ€™t necessary.

## Technique

The very first thing that chiropractors do is examine the horse and identify the side where the pain is located, if the pain is high or low, what is the correct line of drive, and the best way to take the tension away. Adjusting a Clydesdale is not as physically difficult as it would seem. The whole trick is to use leverage and speed. You will notice that almost all of the chiropractors keep a step ladder with them, standing on the step gives them the needed leverage. That is why small women like Dr. Sara and Dr. Julie can adjust these gentle giants. Chiropractors using large amount of force (jumping on or using all bodyweight) should trigger red flags.
